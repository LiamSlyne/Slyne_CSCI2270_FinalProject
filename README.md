Final Project Phase 1

Summary of Program:

	The objective of my program is to create a graph out of the Jungle 
in the video game League of Legends and traverse it.  I plan to give the 
user the choice of what to do either taking the most optimal farming route
through the jungle (graph) or to take a less optimal route through the 
jungle (graph) to help fellow teammates(computers).  I am also going to 
make a struct to contain user data such as name of the champion, level, 
gold, and amount of items. The graph edges will be proportional to the 
amount of time it takes for the certain champion to run there based off of 
in game movement speed.  Things that I am not going to take into 
consideration for sake of simplicity are certain champions abilities to 
cross over walls making the graphs drastically different.  I will be 
creating my own library of items and champions to choose from based of off 
the actual game.
