Final Project Phase 1

Summary of Program:

	The objective of my program is to create a graph out of the Jungle in the video game League of Legends and traverse it.  I plan to give the user the choice of what to do either taking the most optimal farming route through the jungle (graph) or to take a less optimal route through the jungle (graph) to help fellow teammates(computers).  I am also going to make a struct to contain user data such as name of the champion, level, gold, and amount of items. The graph edges will be proportional to the amount of time it takes for the certain champion to run there based off of in game movement speed.  Things that I am not going to take into consideration for sake of simplicity are certain champions abilities to cross over walls making the graphs drastically different.  I will be creating my own library of items and champions to choose from based of off the actual game.
